# Respectfully Randomized Probabilities

Randomizes spell spawn probabilities, but only for spells you have progress on. Currently it scrambles the existing probabilities, so it should result in a vanilla-like distribution with some spells more common in lower tiers, and others only available in high tiers.

Note: many first floor wands draw from their own list and are not affected.
